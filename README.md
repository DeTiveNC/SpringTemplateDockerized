## About The Project

This project provides a solid foundation for building and deploying Spring Boot applications. It comes pre-configured with Docker for containerization, PostgreSQL as the database, and Kubernetes for orchestration. It's designed to help you get your web service up and running quickly, with a focus on modern development practices.

### Features

*   **Spring Boot:** The latest version for building robust Java and Kotlin applications.
*   **Docker:** Containerize your application for consistent environments and easy scaling.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
*   **Kubernetes:** Pre-configured for deploying your application to a K8s cluster.
*   **JWT Authentication:** Secure your endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
*   **Gradle:** A powerful build automation tool.

### Built With

*   [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
*   [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
*   [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
*   [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   JDK 17 or later

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DeTiveNC/SpringTemplateDockerized.git
    ```
2.  **Build the project**
    Use the Gradle wrapper to build the project and create the JAR file.
    ```sh
    ./gradlew build
    ```
3.  **Run with Docker Compose**
    This will start the application and the PostgreSQL database.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Usage

The application exposes the following API endpoints:

*   **Register a new user:**
    `POST /api/auth/register`
    <br>
    Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```
*   **Login:**
    `POST /api/auth/login`
    <br>
    Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```
*   **Health Check:**
    `GET /health`

You can use a tool like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can build and push the Docker image to a container registry.

1.  **Build the Docker image**
    ```sh
    docker compose build
    ```
2.  **Push the Docker image**
    Make sure to tag the image with your registry's username and a tag.
    ```sh
    docker push <your-username>/java-app:<tag-name>
    ```

## Kubernetes

This project includes a `k8s` directory with Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application. You can use a tool like [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) to run a local Kubernetes cluster.

The manifests were generated using [Kompose](https://kompose.io/), which translates Docker Compose files into Kubernetes resources.
